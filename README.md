# cookiecutter-reproducible-ngs

A cookiecutter template for reproducible research, tailored for use with next-generation sequencing projects

The template is loosely based on the project structure setup by
[drivendata](http://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/).

### Requirements to use the cookiecutter template:
-----------
 - Python 3.5 or 3.6
 - [Cookiecutter Python package](http://cookiecutter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html) >= 1.4.0: This can be installed with pip by or conda depending on how you manage your Python packages:

``` bash
$ pip install cookiecutter
```

or

``` bash
$ conda config --add channels conda-forge
$ conda install cookiecutter
```


### To start a new project, run:
------------

    cookiecutter https://github.com/percyfal/cookiecutter-reproducible-ngs


### The resulting directory structure
------------

The directory structure of your new project looks like this: 

```
